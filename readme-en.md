⭕️MataBook 13 2018-2020 you dont have to do anything  
❌MataBook 14 2019-2020 the Framebuffer part of config.plist ⇨ [should be changed to this](https://github.com/ske1996/matebook-13-2019-oc-efi/issues/49)  
but there are some cases which they havent changed anything in config.plist,and their device's hdmi works fine.  
so,if your device's hdmi works,strongly recommand to NOT change anything of config.plist(except MLB,SN)

<summary>How to enable HIDPI：</summary>  
 
⚠️Attention：  
according to your OS version,the program which you will use is different.        
BigSur：[click to download](https://github.com/ske1996/matebook-13-2019-oc-efi/raw/master/Bigsur/%EF%BC%88BigSur%E6%96%B9%E6%A1%882%EF%BC%89hidpi.zip)  
Catalina：https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi  

 

My selection：  
1. enable HiDPi (with patch/inject EDID)ーーーーーーーselete "2" at frist step
2. macbook pro   
3. input 6    
4. input  1600x1066 1343x895 2160x1440  



You should lock your resolution to 1343x895 at setting since you enabled HiDPI.Otherwise you will get bug from wakeup.  


*Attention⚠️you should select resolution like left part of this photo(1343x895 under the monitor),but the correct button(right part of photo) maybe not same as this photo.

<summary>How to disable CFG lock：</summary>  
  
upgrade your bios to 1.28,could be download in HUAWEI's official page  

1.Format a usb memory to fat32  

2.create a new floder named "EFI" at root  

3.create a new floder named "BOOT" At /EFI  

4.download [cfgunlock.zip(click)](https://github.com/ske1996/matebook-13-2019-oc-efi/raw/master/cfgunlock.zip)  

5.copy bootx64.efi from cfgunlock.zip to EFI/BOOT in your usb 

Restart and boot with this usb  

After you boot   

Press alt and "＝" in same time  
(BTW,my keyborad is standard USA version,the hot key is not same between different language version keyboard,so strongly recommand to get an external USA version keyborad for this guide)  

And use ↑and↓ in your keyboard to find "cpusetup"  


And press enter in keyboard to enter "cpusetup"  


You will see this.

0030-0E in your computer must be 01  

Use ←→↑↓ key to pick it and press enter  

Then,put "00" in  

Then,press ctrl and w in same time to save setting   

If save successfully,it will tell you like"update written"(i forget what it was)

Btw.DO NOT use opencore to boot what i uploaded  

That is all of how to unlock cfg in matebook13 2019  

And you will get a perfect power management
